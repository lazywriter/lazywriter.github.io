        bookPersonalReview: 'Like every other Robert Brown novel, The Da Vinci code stood up to its mark. the book was very interesting and it is impossible to keep down the book after starting it. The book provides a detailed narrative and surprises at every end. But it is not my most favourite Robert Brown novel. However, I would recommend yopu tjis book if you are looking for a graet thriller novel.',
