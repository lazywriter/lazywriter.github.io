The Da Vinci Code shares many literary elements, such as conspiracies of secret societies, Ancient history,architecture and symbology are refernced throughout the book.\
      The end of the book was a bit disappointing as compared to the other dan brown mystery novels. But, still I would recommend you to read this book if you are looking for a good mystery thriller.  ",
