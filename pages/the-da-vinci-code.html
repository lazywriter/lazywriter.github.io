           <br> Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer who is the estranded grandaughter of Sauniere explains to Langdon that Bezu Fache , the police captain thinks that Langdon murdered Sauniere because the last line of her grandfather's message said,"P.S Find Robert Langdon" which Fache erased prior to lLangdon's arrival!
           <br> Neveu and Langdon escape the police and visit hte depository bank of Zurich for a safe deposit box. in the safe deposit box they find: a cryptex(a cylindrical vault with five rotating dials labelled with letters) and clues to its password.
           <br>Langdon and Neveu take the cryptex to  Sir Leigh Teabing, a friend of Langdon's who is an expert on the Holy grail. Teabing explains that the Holy Grail is not a cup, but a tomb containing the bones of Mary Magdalene(One of the twelve followers of Jesus).
           the trio then flees the country on Teabing's private plane. They conclude that the proper combination of the letters spell out 'Sophia', the name given to Neveu. the cryptex opens revealing another small cryptex inside it! <br>
           by hte time they arrive at Westminster Abbey, Teabing is reveled to be the master of Silas. Teabing wishes to use the Holy grail to ruin the vatican. he forces Langdon to open the cryptex at gunpoint to solve the cryptex password
           , which Langdo nrealizes is 'apple'. Landon secretly opens the cryptex and throws it after taking the contents. Teabing is alter arrested by Bezu Fache,the police captain who realizes that Langdon is innocent. 
           <br> the final message of the keystone trakes Langs=don and Neveu to Rosslyn Chapel whose docents turn out to be Neveu,s brother and grandmother who she beleived died in a car accident. Neveu also finds that she is the descendant of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene

          <h3>Personal review:</h3>
          <p>
            Like every other Robert Brown novel, The Da Vinci code stood up to its mark. the book was very interesting and it is impossible to keep down the book after starting it.
            The book provides a detailed narrative and surprises at every end. But it is not my most favourite Robert Brown novel. However, I would recommend yopu tjis book if you are looking for a graet thriller novel.
