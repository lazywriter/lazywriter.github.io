                        There are many perceptions on the beginning of the Second World War, its cause, when it started and by whom. 
                        Though the most common perception is that World War 2 began when Nazi Germany invaded Poland on 1st September 1939. <br>

                        however, History is not that tidy; some insist that the war which began with the invasion of Poland in 1939 was the start of Hitler’s drive for Lebensraum (Living space) in the east.  Some insist that the war began with the Spanish Civil War, or with the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war (1937 – 1945) or when Japan invaded the Manchuria region of China in 1931. Some people even believe that the second world war just an extension of the First World War thus making it a 40 years’ war(1914 – 1945). It is therefore important to look back at some of the circumstances which led to this. <br>

                        The terrible effects of the First World War had left the European countries exhausted. Central Europe was fragmented after the treaty of Versailles, their pride shattered. The German soldiers and officers were frustrated. In their views, the mutinies and revolts within Germany in 1918 which caused the Kaiser to abdicate, led by Jewish-Bolsheviks, was their defeat’s main cause. However, the main cause behind the unrest was war-weariness, hunger and poverty. The hyperinflation in 1922-23 caused national and personal shame to all of the German population. German nationalists dreamt of a time when the humiliation of the treaty of Versailles could be reversed. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 hit Germany the hardest; the value of the German Mark fell dramatically.
                        Recent memories of the Russian revolution and the civil wars in Hungary, Finland and the Baltic states greatly increased the process of political polarization. In this new collectivist age, violent solutions appeared supremely heroic to all.

                        In September 1930, the Nationalist Socialist’s Party’s share in votes jumped from 2.5% to 18.3%.The conservative right in Germany which had little respect for democracy destroyed the Weimar Republic, which paved way for Hitler. On 30th January 1933, Hitler became chancellor and quickly removed all the potential opposition. The German population, desperate for law and order, and to retain their pride were eager to follow Hitler. Hitler managed to appeal to their worst instincts: resentment, intolerance, arrogance and worst of all a sense of racial superiority. Opponents found themselves isolated and insulted as traitors in the new regime. Hitler’s greatest talent lay in spotting and exploiting the weakness of his opponents. The left in Germany deeply divided between German communists and the Social Democrats posed no problem. He easily outmaneuvered the conservatives and destroyed all opposition, thus consolidating his power. He then turned his attention to breaking the Treaty of Versailles.
                        Conscription in the army which was banned after the treaty was reintroduced in the 1935. The British agreed to an increase in the German Navy and the Luftwaffe (Air Force) was openly constituted.
                        In March 1936, the German forces reoccupied the Rhineland which was given to the French under the treaty of Versailles. Britain and France made no protest against this accelerated advancements. Hitler had single handedly restored the German pride, halted the rise in unemployment and poverty. Hitler’s desire to make Germany a European power were made quite clear in the Mein Kampf , a combination of autobiography and politics manifesto, first published in 1925.
                        Hitler was not interested in mainly reoccupying the territories lost by Germany after WW1. He wanted all of Central Europe and Russia upto the river Volga for the German lebensraum . His dream was deeply encouraged by the brief German occupation of the Baltic states in 1918. The ‘bread basket’ of Ukraine especially attracted the Germans because Hitler wanted to avoid the conditions of starvation that demoralized the German troops in WW1 due to the British blockade. The main purpose of lebensraum was to seize oil in the east. Germany imported about 85 percent of its oil even during peacetime and this could prove to be its Achilles heel in the war.
                        Hitler intervened in the Spanish Civil War in 1936. He was convinced that a Bolshevik Spain and the leftist government in France could pose a serious threat in his plans. The British didn’t interfere in the conflict because they thought that it could cause another major conflict in Europe which they wanted to avoid at any costs. This allowed the German military support to Francisco Franco’s nationalists while the Luftwaffe experimented new air tactics. Their interference also caused Mussolini and Hitler to come together, Italians sent ‘volunteers’ to fight alongside the nationalists in Spain. But the Italians were not militarily or psychologically ready to enter in a European Conflict, so Germany looked on to obtain another ally for the coming war: This one on the opposite side of the planet……
